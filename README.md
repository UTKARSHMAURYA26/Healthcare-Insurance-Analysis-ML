# Healthcare Insurance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of healthcare insurance data, exploring the relationships between personal attributes, geographic factors, and medical insurance charges. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of a machine learning model for predictive insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Age**: The insured person's age.
- **Sex**: Gender (male or female) of the insured.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children**: The number of dependents covered.
- **Smoker**: Whether the insured is a smoker (yes or no).
- **Region**: The geographic area of coverage.
- **Charges**: The medical insurance costs incurred by the insured person.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Processing**: Checking and handling null values, duplicates, and data types.
2. **Transformation/Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
3. **Standardization**: Standardizing numerical columns to ensure consistent scaling.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing distributions, relationships, and patterns in the data.
5. **Model Development**: Implementing a Linear Regression model for predictive analysis.
6. **Model Inference**: Extracting and interpreting coefficients to understand the impact of different features.

## Results

The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing healthcare insurance charges, with a focus on the impact of age, BMI, smoking habits, and geographic region. The machine learning model offers predictive capabilities for estimating insurance costs based on various attributes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Healthcare_Insurance_Analysis.ipynb`) in a compatible environment.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
